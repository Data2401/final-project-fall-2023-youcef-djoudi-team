## importing the Data
the data is crime statistcis for the city of Houston 2022. the dataset is posted by the City of Houston official website and here is the link (https://www.houstontx.gov/police/cs/Monthly_Crime_Data_by_Street_and_Police_Beat.htm)

```{r}
#install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

file_path <- "NIBRSPublicViewDec22.xlsx"

crime_stats <- read_excel(file_path)
glimpse(crime_stats)

```
##Data set
the data set contains 16 variables and 249912 rows


##Crime stats by zipcode


```{r}
